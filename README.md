# RpsBoy

This is the rock scissors paper playing robot project. This is the opponent to play Rock Paper Scissors. For now it has three-part: first dialog which can communicate. The leapmotion which can track the human gesture. Third it can send commanda to the hand of roboy 2 to make the shape of paper, rock and scissors. For now it is working independently and for the later we want to add ROS to send and receive messages with other parts to make it complete.
The rps_boy contain the files related to robot moving hand. We can send command to robot to mimic the shape of paper, scissors and rock.
The rps_dialog contain the parts related to robot speaking.
